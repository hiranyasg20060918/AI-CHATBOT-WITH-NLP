 AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP
AI Chatbot using Python and NLTK

Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
Domain: Python Programming
Duration: 4 Weeks
Mentor: Neela Santosh


>> Project Overview

This project demonstrates building a simple AI Chatbot in Python using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The chatbot is designed to process user input, understand queries, and provide meaningful responses based on a predefined knowledge base. It showcases the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP), including tokenization, lemmatization, and pattern matching, while providing a simple conversational interface.


>> Objectives

Build a rule-based AI chatbot in Python

Process and clean user input using NLTK

Use tokenization and lemmatization for text preprocessing

Match user queries with a knowledge base to generate responses

Demonstrate the fundamentals of natural language understanding



>> Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: nltk, numpy

IDE: IDLE


>> Process

1. Knowledge Base Creation – A small dictionary of sample queries and responses forms the bot’s knowledge. This can be expanded for more complex conversations.

2. Text Preprocessing – Using NLTK, user input is tokenized into words and lemmatized to reduce words to their base form. Punctuation is removed for better matching.

3. Response Generation – The chatbot checks if any keyword from the knowledge base exists in the user input and returns the corresponding response. If no match is found, it politely asks the user to rephrase.

4. Interactive Loop – The bot interacts with the user via a command-line interface. Typing ‘bye’ ends the conversation.
